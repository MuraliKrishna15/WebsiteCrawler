# WebsiteCrawler
Simple Website Crawler 


How to Build:

1.	Open project solution file in MS Visual Studio.
2.	Hit F6 to build solution. 



How to Run:

1.	Once solution builds successfully, run the “SiteCrawler.exe” file located at the following location,
.\SiteCrawler\bin\Debug
2.	It opens command console and runs through all the report.
3.	Once Site Crawling is finished, it prompts you to hit Enter key to generate and open report.
4.	Report includes number of images present on each page.



What I could have done better:

1.	Could have parameterized input, with winform prompt or console prompt.
2.	Could have concentrated more on Performance and tried to reduce the execution time.
3.	More generic logic to exclude social media or external websites.
